# Tracking-Room-Occupancy
This project focuses on predicting room occupancy using environmental sensor data, such as temperature, CO2 levels, and light intensity. By applying machine learning techniques, specifically Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers, the project aims to achieve high accuracy in occupancy detection.
